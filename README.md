### A relevant increase in the practice of water sports has emerged. Sports such as surfing, body boarding, kayaking, paddling, diving and snorkelling have boomed in the past 20 years. This increment may be related to an increase in shark attacks.

#### Project goal

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate if there is a correlation between increase in shark attacks and the increment of practicing water sports. To explore this, two objectives have been proposed:
- To investigate if shark attacks on humans have increased over time 
- To analyse if practicing water sports has raised as one of the main activities underlying these attacks. 

#### Tools

To unravel this issue, [data](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) about shark attacks from the last 500 years  will be analysed. Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis will be performed using programming python and functions in Pandas library.
