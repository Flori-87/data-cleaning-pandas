### A relevant increase in the practice of water sports has emerged. Sports such as surfing, body boarding, kayaking, paddling, diving and snorkelling have boomed in the past 20 years. This increment may be related to an increase in shark attacks.

#### Project goal

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate if there is a correlation between increase in shark attacks and the increment of practicing water sports. To explore this, three objectives have been proposed:
- To investigate if shark attacks on humans have increased over time 
- To analyse if practicing water sports has raised as one of the main activities underlying these attacks. 
- To study if there is a greater increase in these attacks in countries where these sports are very popular.

#### Tools

To unravel this issue, [data](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) about shark attacks from the last 500 years  will be analysed. Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis will be performed using programming with Python language and Pandas functions.

#### Methods

From the dataset, columns cointaining info about dates when attacks occurred will be cleaned and reduced in one column. Moreover, the column with info about the activity performing during the attack will be manipulated to group the activities into two types: water sports and others.

#### Analysis

From the clean dataset, the column with the info about year when attack occurred will be categorized and grouped by decades. Then, bar graphs will show the number of attacks per decade, the number of attacks in the world by decades on humans practicing water sports or other activity and the number of attacks in the two countries where water sports are more popular.
